            <p class="fs-4 lh-sm"><b>Abstract:</b> We define perceived diversity as the diversity factors that individuals are born with. Perceived
            diversity in Software Engineering has been recognized as a high-value team property and companies are
            willing to increase their efforts to create more diverse work teams. The current diversity state-of-the-art
            shows that gender diversity studies have been growing during the past decade, and they have shown the
            benefits of including women in software teams. However, less is known about how other perceived diversity
            factors such as race, nationality, disability, and age of developers are related to Software Engineering.
            Through a systematic literature review, we aim to clarify the research area concerned with perceived
            diversity in Software Engineering. Our goal is to identify (1) what issues have been studied and what
            results have been reported; (2) what methods, tools, models, and processes have been proposed to help
            perceived diversity issues; and (3) what limitations have been reported when studying perceived diversity in
            Software Engineering. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to identify gaps in the current literature and
            create a call for future action in perceived diversity in Software Engineering. Our results indicate that
            the individual studies have typically had a gender diversity perspective focusing on showing gender bias or
            gender differences instead of developing methods and tools to mitigate the gender diversity issues faced in
            SE. Moreover, perceived diversity aspects related to SE participants’ race, age, and disability need
            to be further analyzed in Software Engineering research. From our systematic literature review, we conclude
            that researchers need to consider a wider set of perceived diversity aspects for future research.
