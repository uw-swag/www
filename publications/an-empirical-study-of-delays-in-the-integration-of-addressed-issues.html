            <p class="fs-4 lh-sm"><b>Abstract:</b> Predicting the time required to address an issue (i.e., a feature, bug fix, or enhancement) has long
            been the goal of many software engineering researchers. However, after an issue has been addressed, it must
            be integrated into an official release to become visible to users. In theory, issues should be integrated
            into releases soon after they are addressed. Yet in practice, the integration of an addressed issue might be
            delayed. For instance, an addressed issue might be delayed in order to assess the impact that it may have on
            the system as a whole. While one can often speculate, it is not always clear why some addressed issues are
            integrated immediately, while others are delayed. In this paper, we empirically study the integration of
            20,995 addressed issues from the Argo UML, Eclipse, and Fire fox projects. Our results indicate that: (i)
            despite being addressed well before the release date, the integration of 34% to 60% of addressed issues in
            systems with traditional release cycle, and 98% of addressed issues in systems with rapid release cycle were
            delayed by one or more releases, (ii) using information derived from the addressed issues, we are able to
            accurately predict the release in which an addressed issue will be integrated, achieving a Receiver Operator
            Curve (ROC) area of above 0.74, and (iii) the workload of integrators is the most influential factor in our
            integration delay models. Our results indicate that integration can introduce non-negligible delays that
            prevent addressed issues from being delivered to users. Thus, solely focusing on the time to address an
            issue is not enough to truly assess how long it takes for users to see that the issue has been addressed in
            the software system.
