            <p class="fs-4 lh-sm"><b>Abstract:</b> Practical guidelines on what code has better quality are in great demand. For example, it is
            reasonable to expect the most complex code to be buggy. Structuring code into reasonably sized files and
            classes also appears to be prudent. Many attempts to determine (or declare) risk thresholds for various code
            metrics have been made. In this paper we want to examine the applicability of such thresholds. Hence, we
            replicate a recently published technique for calculating metric thresholds to determine high-risk files
            based on code size (LOC and number of methods), and complexity (cyclomatic complexity and module interface
            coupling) using a very large set of open and closed source projects written primarily in Java. We relate the
            threshold-derived risk to (a) the probability that a file would have a defect, and (b) the defect density of
            the files in the high-risk group. We find that the probability of a file having a defect is higher in the
            very high-risk group with a few exceptions. This is particularly pronounced when using size thresholds.
            Surprisingly, the defect density was uniformly lower in the very high-risk group of files. Our results
            suggest that, as expected, less code is associated with fewer defects. However, the same amount of code in
            large and complex files was associated with fewer defects than when located in smaller and less complex
            files. Hence we conclude that risk thresholds for size and complexity metrics have to be used with caution
            if at all. Our findings have immediate practical implications: the redistribution of Java code into smaller
            and less complex files may be counterproductive.
