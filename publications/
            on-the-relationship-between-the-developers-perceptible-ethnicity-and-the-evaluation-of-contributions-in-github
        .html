            <p class="fs-4 lh-sm"><b>Abstract:</b> Open Source Software (OSS) projects are typically the result of collective efforts performed by
            developers with different backgrounds. Although the quality of developers' contributions should be the only
            factor influencing the evaluation of the contributions to OSS projects, recent studies have shown that
            diversity issues are correlated with the acceptance or rejection of developers' contributions. This paper
            assists this emerging state-of-the-art body on diversity research with the first empirical study that
            analyzes how developers' perceptible race and ethnicity relates to the evaluation of the contributions in
            OSS. We performed a large-scale quantitative study of OSS projects in GitHub. We extracted the developers'
            perceptible race and ethnicity from their names in GitHub using the Name-Prism tool and applied regression
            modeling of contributions (i.e, pull requests) data from GHTorrent and GitHub. We observed that among the
            developers whose perceptible race and ethnicity was captured by the tool, only 16.56% were perceptible as
            Non-White developers; contributions from perceptible White developers have about 6-10% higher odds of being
            accepted when compared to contributions from perceptible Non-White developers; and submitters with
            perceptible non-white races and ethnicities are more likely to get their pull requests accepted when the
            integrator is estimated to be from their same race and ethnicity rather than when the integrator is
            estimated to be White. Our initial analysis shows a low number of Non-White developers participating in OSS.
            Furthermore, the results from our regression analysis lead us to believe that there may exist differences
            between the evaluation of the contributions from different perceptible races and ethnicities. Thus, our
            findings reinforce the need for further studies on racial and ethnic diversity in software engineering to
            foster healthier OSS communities.
