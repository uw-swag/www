            <p class="fs-4 lh-sm"><b>Abstract:</b> A Github Survey Identified that 30% of GitHub developers are aware of the ethnicity of their team
            members and that 30% of GitHub developers have faced some form of negative experience because of their
            country of origin, their language, and their ideology. Furthermore, the 2017 GitHub open source survey2
            reported that 11% of GitHub’s respondents had witnessed stereotyping and 3% had experienced
            stereotyping in the open source software (OSS) community.
            <br/><br/>
            These findings motivate the need to understand whether there is racial-based bias from GitHub developers
            when rejecting the pull requests submitted by different racial groups. This understanding will be the first
            step in helping OSS developers take the necessary steps to foster a healthy OSS community. As we can
            identify only the perceptible race of developers based on their GitHub usernames, we will refer to the
            developers’ race in our article as “perceptible race.”
            <br/><br/>
            To shed new light on the perceptible race issues that may affect the rejections of pull requests in GitHub,
            we conducted a qualitative study to reveal whether there is any evidence of bias based on perceptible race
            in the written comments of nonmerged pull requests in GitHub. Since this is a qualitative analysis with
            small and focused samples, we sought in-depth reasoning and quality of results rather than the use of any
            statistical tools in the process.
