            <p class="fs-4 lh-sm"><b>Abstract:</b> Code coverage measures the degree to which source code elements (e.g., statements, branches) are
            invoked during testing. Despite growing evidence that coverage is a problematic measurement, it is often
            used to make decisions about where testing effort should be invested. For example, using coverage as a
            guide, tests should be written to invoke the non-covered program elements. At their core, coverage
            measurements assume that invocation of a program element during any test is equally valuable and only
            provide a binary covered-or-not classification of program elements. Yet in reality, tests have varied
            characteristics and coverage can be enriched by incorporating these test characteristics. In this thesis, we
            expand code coverage classification by adding scope (e.g., unit, function) and reliability (flaky vs.
            robust) characteristics of the tests to the coverage report. We perform an empirical study of three large
            software systems from the OpenStack community, namely, Nova, Neutron, and Cinder.

            We generate an enriched statement coverage report and glean additional insights. We observe that 60.94% and
            63.33% of statements are covered by both unit and functional tests in Neutron and Nova, respectively, while
            only 30% are covered by both types of tests in Cinder. We find that systems are disproportionately impacted
            by flakily covered statements with 5% and 10% of the covered statements in Nova and Neutron being flakily
            covered, respectively, while <1% of Cinder statements are flakily covered. We also find that incidences
            of flakily covered statements could not be well explained by solely using code characteristics, such as
            dispersion, ownership, and development activity. In order to understand the cost effectiveness of enriching
            code coverage, we propose GreedyFlake – a test effort prioritization algorithm to maximize return on
            investment when tackling the problem of flakily covered program elements. We find that GreedyFlake
            outperforms baseline approaches by at least eight percentage points of Area Under the Cost Effectiveness
            Curve.
